# GWAS Catalog Harmonisation Pipeline

The GWAS Summary Statistics Data Harmonisation pipeline is designed to standardise variant data, align it with the latest genome assembly (GRCh38), and ensure allele consistency with reference datasets. Key steps include genome assembly mapping, palindromic variant orientation inference, harmonisation with a reference, and quality control to remove incomplete or invalid records.
